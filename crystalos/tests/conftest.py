"""Shared fixtures for agents unit tests.

Tests are isolated from the real LLM APIs by mocking `call_agent()`.
This ensures:
  - Tests run without API keys
  - Tests are deterministic (no flaky LLM non-determinism)
  - Tests are fast (no network calls)

Integration tests (with real API calls) live in agents/evals/.
