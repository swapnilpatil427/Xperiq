"""Insight generation scheduler.

Runs as a separate process (not part of the FastAPI server).
Periodically enqueues insight generation for surveys that:
  - Have responses (response_count > 0)
  - Haven't been regenerated recently (based on tier interval)
  - Are in 'active' or 'paused' status (closed surveys are excluded)

Usage:
  python -m agents.scheduler

Or via the Makefile:
  make scheduler

Interval env vars:
  INSIGHT_INTERVAL_FREE_MIN   default: 120  (minutes between free-tier runs)
  INSIGHT_INTERVAL_PAID_MIN   default: 15   (minutes between paid-tier runs)
  SCHEDULER_POLL_SEC          default: env-aware (dev: 300s, prod: 3600s)
