/**
 * Prism LOAD — exactly-once natural-key UPSERT into responses / signals.
 *
 * Guarantees (architecture-ingestion.md §4):
 *   1. Per-natural-key serialization via pg_advisory_xact_lock(hashtext(org||key))
 *      — concurrent writers to one key serialize inside the batch txn (no lost-update).
 *   2. Source-time monotonicity — DO UPDATE only overwrites when the incoming
 *      record's source_observed_at >= the stored one. A late backfill describing an
 *      OLDER state is dropped as a no-op, never clobbering a fresher live edit.
 *   3. Hash no-op — equal source-time + equal payload_hash → no write at all.
 *   4. Batched transactions (≤500 rows) — the unit of retry and of lost-work on crash.
 *      Original source timestamps preserved (submitted_at, NEVER import time).
 *
 * The natural key is (org_id, metadata->'prism'->>'source_platform',
 * metadata->'prism'->>'source_record_id'), matched by a unique partial index.
 *
 * A COPY → staging → MERGE fast-path stub is provided for the bulk burst path
 * (operations-runbook.md §2.3); it is gated off until pg-copy-streams is added.
